# detectcolor
A simple python program to detect colors in an uploaded image. I used Django Framework so that we can use it in a webview than a CLI tool.
I have given a small color range to detect, but can be increased to work for many colors.

This is to detect colors in uploaded image file

Here is the uploaded image :

<img src="https://github.com/rathankalluri/detectcolor/blob/master/uploads/cirlces.jpg" width="300" style="padding:5px 5px"/>

Here are colors extracted :

<img src="https://github.com/rathankalluri/detectcolor/blob/master/uploads/cirlces-1.jpg" width="300" style="padding:5px 5px"/>
<img src="https://github.com/rathankalluri/detectcolor/blob/master/uploads/cirlces-2.jpg" width="300" style="padding:5px 5px"/>
<img src="https://github.com/rathankalluri/detectcolor/blob/master/uploads/cirlces-3.jpg" width="300" style="padding:5px 5px"/>
<img src="https://github.com/rathankalluri/detectcolor/blob/master/uploads/cirlces-4.jpg" width="300" style="padding:5px 5px"/>

__inti__.py needs to be created..after you fork the build.

This project needs some enhancement.
